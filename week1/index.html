        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <P>
            Hello, my name is Suleman Aswat. I was born here, but my parents are from India. I can speak many languages, including English, French, Gujarati, Urdu, Hindi, and Arabic. I’ve always had a passion for IT, which is why I’m pursuing a diploma in Computing and Information Technology at BCIT. My journey began in high school when I worked as a Pharmacy Assistant at Shoppers Drug Mart, where I gained valuable experience in customer service and healthcare. I also volunteered with several charities, which helped me improve my communication skills.
        </P>
        <p>Currently, I am working towards earning my diploma and plan to begin my Bachelor of Computer Science part-time at BCIT. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer after completing my degree.
